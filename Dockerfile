# The Avsarathi engine: FastAPI, the discovery corpus, WhatsApp and speech.
#
# The corpus is fetched at BUILD time, not at boot. On a free tier the service
# spins down when idle, so anything downloaded at startup is downloaded again
# on every cold start — and a WhatsApp webhook times out while it happens.
# Baked into the image it costs one slow build and nothing thereafter.

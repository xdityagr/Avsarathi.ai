/**
 * What someone has told us about themselves, kept on their own device.
 *
 * The gap this closes: the wizard already asks category, gender, state and
 * income, then throws the answers away on navigation. So the assistant asked
 * again, and the application pack could fill exactly one field. Everything the
 * product knew about a person lasted until they clicked a link.
 *
 * ON THE DEVICE, DELIBERATELY
 *
 * `localStorage`, not a cookie and not a row in our database. A cookie rides on
 * every request whether or not it is needed, and a row means we hold a poor
 * household's income and community on a server they cannot see. This travels
 * only when it is the point of the request — the matcher, or filling a form —
 * and clearing it is one button that actually clears it.
 *
 * That is also why there is no sync and no account. An account is a barrier for
 * someone borrowing a relative's phone, and this audience often is.
 *
 * NO AADHAAR NUMBER
 *
 * There is no field for it and there will not be. An Aadhaar number typed into
 * a website is what this audience is most often defrauded with, and no scheme
 * match needs it. Offline e-KYC fills the fields below from a UIDAI-signed
 * file that does not contain the number either — only the last four digits,
 * and we do not keep those.

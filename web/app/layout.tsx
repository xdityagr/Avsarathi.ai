/*
 * Fonts are served from our own origin rather than fetched from Google.
 * Two reasons, and the second is the real one: the build machine cannot always
 * reach fonts.gstatic.com, and neither can a user on a weak rural connection —
 * a page whose text is invisible until a third party responds is a page that
 * fails exactly the people this is built for.
 *
 * Only the two Latin faces are declared here. The nine Indic and Arabic faces
 * are @font-face rules in globals.css with a unicode-range apiece, so a reader
 * downloads the alphabet they are actually reading and none of the others.

 * The assistant, as a mark.
 *
 * The same sunrise the pages are washed in, compressed into a disc. It turns
 * slowly while a question is being worked on and is perfectly still the rest
 * of the time — which is what makes the movement read as thinking rather than
 * as decoration. If everything on the site moved, this would mean nothing.
 *
 * Lives here rather than inside the chat panel because it is the assistant's
 * face everywhere it is offered: the rail, the conversation, the launcher, and
 * the invitation at the foot of a scheme page. One mark, one file.

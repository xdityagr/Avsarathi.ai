"""
Aadhaar Paperless Offline e-KYC verification.

This is what separates a recommender from an origination layer. A recommendation
is advice, and a partner has to redo the work. A recommendation attached to
cryptographically verified identity is something a partner can act on.

WHY THIS IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT A LICENCE. Aadhaar *authentication* (the online API)
requires being an AUA/KUA, which needs UIDAI onboarding. Paperless Offline e-KYC
is a different mechanism entirely: the resident downloads their own XML from
UIDAI's site, protected by a share code they choose, and hands it over. The file
is signed by UIDAI. Verifying that signature makes us an Offline Verification
Seeking Entity — no licence, no onboarding, and we never see or store an Aadhaar
number. The reference ID carries only the last four digits.

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOESN'T. It proves name, date of birth, gender and
address, signed by UIDAI. It does NOT prove caste or income — those are separate
certificates, and pulling them needs DigiLocker Requester onboarding (PRD-v3 §8,
rung L2). So eligibility here is never gated on verification: an unverified user
gets the same recommendation, graded DECLARED. The ladder degrades, it never
blocks.

"""
Tier 3 — partner routing.

The PS calls this deliverable a "Locator & Router", names the failure mode as
"misrouted applications", and asks that applications aren't sent to partners
with high NPAs or overdues. Reading it as a locator drops half the requirement.

Two things make this more than a distance sort:

1. HARD EXCLUSIONS STAY HARD. A partner that legally cannot disburse is removed,
   never merely down-weighted — and it is removed WITH A REASON, in a sentence
   fit to show a user. Explaining the exclusion is what makes the prudential
   logic visible instead of magic.

2. IT IS AN OPTIMISER, NOT A FILTER. "Better fund utilisation" is a stated PS
   impact goal, and it needs two DIFFERENT signals that are easy to collapse:

     - fresh-release eligibility — utilisation >= 100% and no overdues. Governs
       whether NSFDC releases NEW money to that agency.
     - deployable headroom — funds already released but not yet disbursed.

   A partner sitting on idle funds is one the system should route applicants
   TOWARD. That is literally what better fund utilisation means, and it is the
   opposite of what a naive "high utilisation is good" filter does.

Plus the borrower's own cost: Udyam Nidhi is 13% through a cooperative bank and
15% through a small finance bank. Same scheme, same borrower, different price,
decided purely by which door they walk through. Nobody tells beneficiaries this.

The result shape deliberately mirrors the eligibility engine's matches/rejections
split — the same discipline at both layers.

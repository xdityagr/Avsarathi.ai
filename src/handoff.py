"""
Carrying a conversation from the website into WhatsApp.

Someone answers six questions on the site, gets their matches, and then wants
to carry on where they actually talk. Today that is a fresh start: the deep
link opens WhatsApp with a fixed sentence, and the first thing the assistant
does is ask which state they live in — which they answered four minutes ago.
Being asked again is the clearest possible signal that nobody was listening.

WhatsApp gives us nothing to hold onto. The deep link carries text and nothing
else; there are no parameters, no session, and the phone number is not known
until the person messages us. So the state has to travel inside the only thing
that crosses: the message body.

Hence a code. The website mints one, parks the context behind it, and puts it
in the prefilled message. The first WhatsApp message redeems it and the
assistant carries on knowing what it already knew.

DELIBERATELY SHORT-LIVED AND SINGLE-USE

The context holds what someone told the wizard — their state, their community,
sometimes their household income. That is not a credential, but it is theirs,
and a code that stays valid forever in a message anyone can forward is a way
of leaking it. Thirty minutes, one redemption, then gone.

The alphabet omits O/0 and I/1/L. People read these aloud and type them on a
phone keyboard, and a code that cannot be transcribed is worse than no code.

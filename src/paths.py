"""
Where the data lives, in one place.

`data/` was hardcoded in eight modules, which is fine on a laptop and wrong
everywhere else. A container has its own filesystem layout, and Render mounts a
persistent disk at a path it chooses, not one we choose — so the directory has
to be a setting rather than a literal.

TWO KINDS OF DATA, AND THEY DO NOT BELONG TOGETHER

The corpus (`schemes.db`) is a BUILD ARTEFACT. It is 283 MB, read-only at
runtime, rebuilt by an ingest that takes hours, and identical for every
deployment. It belongs in the image, baked in at build time.

Everything else — who has opted out of WhatsApp, which messages have been
answered, the geocoding cache — is STATE. It is tiny, it is written to, and it
must survive a restart. It belongs on a disk, or in a database.

Conflating them is how you end up either shipping a 283 MB file to a
persistent volume on every deploy, or losing someone's opt-out because it was
stored next to a file you replace.

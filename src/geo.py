"""
Turning where someone is into a state, a district and a PIN code.

Scheme eligibility is overwhelmingly state-scoped, so the single most valuable
thing we can learn without asking a question is which state the person is
standing in. The previous build asked them to pick from five hardcoded cities,
which is not a location feature — it is a dropdown that excludes 99% of India.

Three routes in, in order of how little they ask of the person:

1. **Browser geolocation** — one tap, no typing. Coordinates are reverse
   geocoded through us, not from their browser, so the lookup carries our
   identifying User-Agent and one shared cache rather than their IP hitting a
   public service directly.
2. **PIN code** — six digits, which people know by heart and can read off any
   letter. Resolved against India Post's own directory.
3. **Pick a state** — always available, needs no network and no permission.

Every lookup is cached on disk. These directories change on the order of years,
a demo should not depend on a third party being up, and both services are free
public goods that deserve to be asked once rather than once per user.

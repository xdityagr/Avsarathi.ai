"""
Shared test fixtures.

Before this file existed, each DB-touching test module rolled its own temp-database
setup, and the two implementations disagreed:

- test_phase0.py patched src.database.get_settings (correct, but local)
- test_cache.py and test_llm.py MUTATED the @lru_cache'd Settings singleton and
  never restored it, so whatever they set leaked into every module and every test
  that ran afterwards. That made the suite order-dependent — a latent bug that
  had not bitten yet only because the leaked value happened to be harmless.
- test_buttons.py used no fixture at all and wrote a real data/avsarathi.db.

The autouse fixture below gives every test its own throwaway database and puts the
singleton back the way it found it. Mutating the cached Settings object inside a
test is still fine — it just no longer escapes the test that did it.

"""
What the WhatsApp worker does with a message.

Replaces the old button-routing tests, which asserted that the worker ran its
own LangGraph and replied with Twilio Content Templates. Both are gone: WhatsApp
now answers through the same brain as the website, because the channel that
reaches the most people was the one still asking "business loan or education
loan?" — and buttons went with it, since they need pre-approved templates and
the guided flow numbers its options instead, which a person can type or dictate.

"""
Filling a form, and carrying a conversation across to WhatsApp.

The first test in this file is the one that matters most: the assistant must
never claim to have submitted an application. It cannot, and a person who
believes it did will stop chasing the office and miss the window — which is a
worse outcome than never applying, and is exactly what every agent who charges
a poor household a fee for a free scheme also promises.

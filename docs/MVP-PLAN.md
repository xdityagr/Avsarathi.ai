# MVP Plan & Pitch — Avsarathi.ai

**Target: a 4-minute pitch that wins the room, plus Q&A.**
Companion to `PRD-v3.md` (features), `data-sources.md` (corpus), `BUSINESS-PLAN.md` (scale story).

> **Build status as of 2026-09-07** — branch `feat/mvp-corpus-routing`, 221 tests passing.
> 11 of 14 items done, plus a web product that was never in this plan. Two things
> in the pitch script below no longer match what exists — both are marked in §1 and
> listed in §2.2. Read those before rehearsing.

---

## 0. The principle

**Build backwards from the pitch.** Write the demo script first, then build only what it needs. Every feature that isn't on screen in those four minutes is Phase 2 — no matter how good it is.

This is not scope-cutting for its own sake. `PRD-v3.md` §12 sets a fallback ladder for a reason: the failure mode for a six-person team with three surfaces is arriving with three things half-done. A tight, rehearsed, fully-working four minutes beats a broad demo that stalls once.

---

## 1. The pitch — 4:00

### 0:00–0:30 · Open with a person, not a statistic

> **Sunita Devi. Ballia district, Uttar Pradesh.** She wants to start a tailoring unit. It will cost ₹1.2 lakh.
>
> There is a government scheme that will lend her 90% of that at **6.5%** — cheaper than any commercial loan in India. She has never heard of it.
>
> And if she had: she wouldn't know which of **five** products fits her, which of **102** channel partners can process it, or whether that partner is even *allowed* to disburse this month.
>
> So she borrows from a moneylender at **5% a month**.

Do not open with the scheme, the ministry, or the tech. Open with her. Everything after this is in service of that sentence.

### 0:30–2:30 · Live demo

| Time | Beat | What the judge sees |
|---|---|---|
| 0:30 | **She types in Hindi** | She types *मुझे सिलाई की दुकान खोलनी है* and the whole app answers in Hindi. Say: *"we never asked her what language she speaks — we detected the script"*. **Voice is NOT built** — do not promise a spoken reply |
| 0:55 | **Six taps, no form** | Purpose, cost, family income, category, who's applying, where. Every question has tappable options; typing is optional. Fast — don't linger |
| 1:10 | **The Why / Why-Not trail** | *Qualifies* for Micro Finance — here's the arithmetic. Does **not** qualify for Term Loan — **and here's why.** Explaining the rejection is the literacy moment |
| 1:20 | **True Cost + Moneylender Comparison** | *"This loan costs her ₹12,568. The same money from a moneylender would cost ₹1,78,200."* **Stop talking for one beat.** This is the emotional peak of the pitch |
| 1:45 | **Map — and an exclusion** | Nearest partners, on a real map. Then show one that is **excluded**, with the reason: *"this agency hasn't utilised its last release — it cannot disburse right now."* Prudential routing, made visible |
| 2:10 | **Cheapest Scheme** | *"She qualifies for three schemes. Micro Finance costs ₹12,568. Udyam Nidhi costs ₹41,957. Same project, same ₹1.08 lakh, ₹29,389 apart — and nobody tells her."* |

> **Every rupee figure above is produced by the code**, not written for the slide. Re-run
> `format_true_cost` / `format_moneylender_comparison` / `format_scheme_comparison`
> before the pitch and copy what comes out. An earlier draft of this script quoted
> ₹22,300, which the calculator does not produce — the script follows the code.

### 2:30–3:15 · The three reveals

This is where you separate from every other team. Deliver them as *"and here's what most people miss."*

> **One.** The problem statement names three schemes. **NSFDC runs five.** The PS's own quoted range — 6.5% to 15% — is arithmetically impossible with three products. We found that by reading the source instead of the brief.
>
> **Two.** Everyone assumes fund-utilisation data is internal to NSFDC. **They publish it.** *[show the spreadsheet]* This is the file dated 31 July. Our router runs on real numbers, not mocks.
>
> **Three.** Her eligibility isn't self-declared — it's **verified against UIDAI's own digital signature**, with no licence required. *[badge flips `DECLARED` → `VERIFIED`]*

### 3:15–4:00 · Scale, the other side, and close

> One engine, **six corporations** — SC, ST, OBC, Safai Karamcharis, minorities, disability.
>
> India's flagship credit portal, **JanSamarth, carries 15 schemes and 269 banks — and zero of these.** Not an oversight: it's built for direct bank lending, and these lend through State Channelizing Agencies. **This is the one large government credit channel with no digital front door.**
>
> And for the agency on the other side: a queue of pre-verified applications, sorted by completeness — instead of a pile of paper. **(Say this as roadmap. The partner console is NOT currently in the UI — see §2.2.)**
>
> Sunita gets the right scheme, at the right price, from a partner who can actually pay her — and she makes **one trip instead of four.**

## 2. MVP build sheet

### 2.1 Status against the original 14

Sizes were relative (S ≈ half a day, M ≈ 1–2 days, L ≈ 3+). **11 of 14 done.**

| # | Item | Status | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Plane A corpus — 5 schemes | **Done** | `corpus/v1/schemes.json`, `src/corpus/` |
| 2 | Tier 1 on 5 schemes | **Done** | `src/schemes.py` |
| 3 | Why / Why-Not trail | **Done** | `EligibilityResult.rejections` with stable `rule` tags |
| 4 | Calculator — quarterly + True Cost | **Done** | `src/calculator.py` (`periods_per_year`) |
| 5 | Moneylender Comparison | **Done** | `src/literacy.py` |
| 6 | Utilisation data ingest | **Done, real** | `src/corpus/ingest.py` — 36 states × 9 FYs, to 31 Jul 2026 |
| 7 | Routing + exclusion reasons | **Done** | `src/routing.py` |
| 8 | Map | **Done** | `src/maps.py` — OSM tiles, local cache, offline after one run |
| 9 | Cheapest Scheme + Route | **Done** | Scheme comparison live; partner-rate route stays silent unless a spread is published |
| 10 | Script detection + Hindi | **Exceeded** | 5 languages, not 2 — `src/i18n.py` |
| 11 | Voice in/out | **Not built** | Deliberately deferred |
| 12 | Partner console | **Regressed** | Existed as a tab; the chat rebuild dropped it — see §2.2 |
| 13 | Aadhaar offline XML verify | **Done** | `src/verification.py`, real XMLDSig |
| 14 | Demo ops + cache warming | **Partial** | Tile cache works; no warm-up script yet |

### 2.2 Two gaps that change the pitch

**The partner console is gone from the UI.** It existed as a tab in the first
web portal — a table of every agency with its utilisation and provenance. The
chat-first rebuild replaced that portal and the tab went with it. The engine and
`/api/partners` still work, so it is a UI rebuild, not a data problem. Until it
is back, the 3:30 beat is roadmap, not a demo.

**Voice does not exist.** Script detection on *typed* text is what is built, and
it is genuinely good — type in Devanagari and the whole app switches to Hindi
from the first message. But the original 0:30 beat promised a spoken reply.
Do not promise it.

### 2.3 Built beyond the plan

None of this was in the original 14. It came out of the work and it is now the
larger half of the demo.

| What | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Chat-first web product** (`/app`) | The plan assumed WhatsApp plus one console screen. There is now a full conversational web app: splash, language pick, six tappable questions, rich result cards. This is the thing a judge will actually be shown |
| **Landing page** (`/`) | Somewhere to send a judge or a partner that explains the product in ten seconds |
| **Five languages** | Hindi, English, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil — chosen by SC population. Numbers are never translated, only formatted, so a translation bug cannot change what a loan costs |
| **`src/chat.py`** | Same engine as WhatsApp, different presentation: structured cards for a browser instead of the text block WhatsApp is limited to |
| **Provenance-stamped corpus** | Every scheme number carries its source URL and fetch date. This is what makes "we read the source" checkable rather than a claim |
| **Declarative scraper** | `data-sources.md` §7 — a source registry plus extractor strategies, not twenty bespoke scripts |
| **Aadhaar demo mode** | A clearly-labelled demonstration certificate so reveal 3 is showable without UIDAI's real cert, and never presented as UIDAI's |
| **Custom-element library** | `src/web/av.js` — the cards render from API data, so adding a card type is a server change |

### 2.4 Bugs found and fixed — say these if asked what went wrong

Worth having ready. "What broke?" is a common judge question and a specific
answer beats a shrug.

- **The app could not start.** `AsyncSqliteSaver.from_conn_string()` returns an
  async context manager, not a saver; `.setup()` on it raised. Unit tests stubbed
  the checkpointer, so nothing caught it until the server ran for real.
- **Business loans were offered to education applicants.** Project types lived in
  a module-level dict and a scheme missing from it matched *everything* — which
  happened the moment the corpus grew past three schemes.
- **Quarterly loans were priced monthly**, and every scheme used one global
  84-month tenure instead of its own.
- **A single message contradicted itself**: the intro quoted a 6-month grace and
  `rate_max` while the block underneath said 3 months and used `rate_min`.
- **Men were quoted the women's rebate** — the rate was reduced whenever the
  scheme had a rebate, without checking gender.
- **A Ballia applicant was routed to the Bihar agency.** An SCA channels funds
  within its own state; distance alone cannot make that valid.
- **The prudential rule was inverted.** Low utilisation was *excluding* agencies,
  but an agency below 100% is by definition sitting on undeployed funds. The PS
  names its exclusion criteria as "high NPAs or overdues" — not low utilisation —
  and excluding idle-fund agencies is the opposite of the fund-utilisation goal.

### 2.5 Still explicitly NOT built — say these as roadmap

Voice in and out · telephony IVR · L5 origination, project report (DPR) and
packet assembly · DigiLocker caste/income pull (rung L2) · assisted CSC mode ·
Ground-Truth Loop · the other five corporations (schema ready, unpopulated) ·
full Plane B / Ask Anything.

Every one is specified in `PRD-v3.md`. A judge asking "can you do X" and hearing
*"yes — here is exactly how, it is phase 2"* costs nothing. A half-built X that
breaks on stage costs the round.

**The one worth adding if there is time:** ~10 hardcoded FAQ pairs so an
unexpected question gets an answer instead of a wall. Half a day, disproportionate
insurance.

## 3. Team split — six people, six lanes

Mapped to layer boundaries so the interfaces are already defined and people don't collide.

| # | Lane | Owns | Items |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Corpus & scraper** | `data-sources.md` §7 pipeline, Plane A, utilisation ingest | 1, 6 |
| 2 | **Rules & money** | Tier 1, calculator, literacy templates | 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| 3 | **Channel** | WhatsApp, language detection, voice | 10, 11 |
| 4 | **Routing & maps** | Prudential optimiser, geo, exclusion reasons | 7, 8, 9 |
| 5 | **Console** | Partner web surface | 12 |
| 6 | **Verification & demo ops** | Aadhaar verify, cache warming, rehearsal, pitch | 13, 14 |

Lanes 1 and 2 are the critical path — nothing demos without the corpus and the rules. **Lane 3's voice work is the single biggest technical risk; it starts on day one, not when the rest is done.**

The national rule is 6 members with at least 1 female member. Lane 6 doubles as the pitch owner, and per `rules.md` every member must be able to field a question on any component — rehearse cross-lane, not just your own.

---

## 4. What is left, in order

The original four-week sequence is spent. This is what remains.

**1. Look at the UI.** Two design passes shipped without being seen in a browser
(Chrome on the dev machine cannot reach the local server — TLS interception on
the tunnel, and localhost is unreachable from it). Nothing else matters until
someone opens `/app` on a phone and a laptop and says whether it is good.

**2. Rebuild the partner console** (§2.2). One screen: the agency table with
utilisation and provenance that `/api/partners` already returns. Without it the
3:30 beat has nothing behind it.

**3. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY`.** Free-text understanding currently falls back to
keyword matching. It handles *"I want to open a small tailoring shop"*; it will
not handle a genuinely open question.

**4. Twilio Sandbox** for the live WhatsApp demo — setup is in the README. The
graph is proven end to end; only the transport is untested.

**5. Voice**, if there is time, and only after everything above is solid.

**6. Cache warming + rehearsal.** §5 below. Stop writing code with real buffer
left; that time is worth more spent breaking the demo deliberately.

## 5. Demo ops — the part teams skip and lose on

**Pre-warm every cache on the demo path.** No live LLM call should sit on the critical path. Run the exact demo profile beforehand so every explanation, translation and TTS clip is cached. A cache-warm demo is deterministic; a cold one is a coin flip on somebody's rate limit.

**Three fallback layers, rehearsed in order:**
1. Live WhatsApp on real infrastructure — the goal
2. Local instance on the laptop, phone on hotspot — if venue wifi fails
3. Screen recording of the full flow — if everything fails. *Record it in week 3, not the night before*

**Deliberately break it in rehearsal.** Income of exactly ₹5,00,000 (the boundary a judge will test). A profile that matches nothing → No Dead Ends must fire. Two messages sent back to back. A voice note with background noise. An out-of-category user. If any produces a dead end or a silence, that's a bug, not an edge case.

**Own the mock disclosure — don't get caught by it.** Branch-level utilisation and RRB NPA figures are still mocked (`data-sources.md` §5.1). Say it before a judge asks, in the same breath as reveal 2: *"state-level utilisation is real and published; branch-level isn't published by anyone, so that's representative data, and here's the rule it feeds."* Volunteered, it's rigour. Extracted under questioning, it's a gap.

---

## 6. Q&A prep — the four questions that will come

**"How much of this is real versus mocked?"**
Lead with the split. Scheme data, eligibility rules, partner directory, state-level utilisation: real and sourced. Branch-level utilisation and RRB NPA series: mocked, because no public source publishes them — and that's a finding, not a gap. The *rules* are real in every case.

**"Isn't the government already building this?"**
PM SURAJ exists and we integrate with it rather than compete. JanSamarth exists and covers 15 schemes — none of these. Our defensible position is being the operator they adopt, not the portal they replace.

**"You're charging poor people to access welfare?"**
No. Eligibility, EMI, literacy, the locator and the checklist are free permanently. Only optional assisted filing is ever paid, the free path is shown with equal prominence, and the beneficiary is the **last** payer in the waterfall behind CSR, partner and B2G. Target: beneficiary-paid share trends to zero.

**"Why should we believe your numbers when your own docs say sources disagree?"**
Because we resolved it and can show our work. The rate conflict was a wrong-model problem — three schemes versus five. The income conflict was stale data: ₹5 lakh, rural and urban, effective 7 January 2026. Every field in our corpus carries a source URL and a fetch date. **That the information is this fragmented is the problem statement's own thesis — and it's why a maintained corpus is the product.**

---

**"Is that Aadhaar check real?"**
The cryptography is real: full enveloped XMLDSig verification — the document is
canonicalised, digested and compared, then the signature is RSA-verified over the
signed info. Tampering with the name or the address is caught, and the tests prove
it. What is not real in the demo is the *certificate*: UIDAI distributes its own
and we do not bundle it, so the demo verifies against a clearly-labelled
demonstration certificate and says so on screen. On a real file it is the same
check. Also worth saying: this needs no licence — offline e-KYC makes us an
Offline Verification Seeking Entity, not an AUA, and the file contains no Aadhaar
number at all.

**"Why should we trust the interface if you built it fast?"**
Everything a borrower sees that involves money is a deterministic template, not
model output — `src/literacy.py`. No rupee figure on screen can be hallucinated.
The model writes the greeting, nothing else.

---

## 7. The one-sentence version

> Every other platform tells you which scheme you *might* qualify for. Avsarathi proves you qualify, tells you what the loan actually costs against the moneylender you'd otherwise use, and routes you to a partner that can actually disburse this month — in your language, by voice if you can't read.
